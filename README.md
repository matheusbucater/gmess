# gmess - go message

A simple app with a simple idea written in a simple language.

Here's the ideia: this app has a core concept that can't change:
- Messages: they have an id, a text and the created_at and updated_at dates. That's it and it can't change.
+ additionally we will use a Features table to make it easer to keep track of wich features each message has.

Then features will be added on top of this core concept and I will be challenged (while having fun '-') trying to implement these features without changing the Messages/Features table.

Some features I intend to implement:
- [x] Notifications
- [x] Todos
- [ ] Lists
